The vision of stamp is to embrace the influx of travelers while the covid-19 pandemic lockdowns are slowly phasing out. It will give travelers a fun competition while rewarding them by expanded their social presence.

# How it works
The app will track the distance that you have travelled and rank you on a leaderboard.
You will be able to then see story style content from the 6 users who rank the closest to you, 3 higher and 3 lower. If you like their content you can request to be their friend to always see content from them.
